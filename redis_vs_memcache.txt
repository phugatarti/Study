Redis vs Memcache
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/memcached-vs-redis-which-one-pick-ranjeet-vimal/

While designing any caching system we consider following points:
* Read/write speed.
* Memory usage.
* Disk I/O dumping.
* Scaling.


Redis
Redis is In-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker.
NoSQL family
key-value data model
data structure server.


Memcached is a volatile in-memory key/value store

Why Memcached?
Memcached could be preferable when caching relatively small and static data, such as HTML code fragments.
internal memory management, is more efficient in the simplest use cases because it consumes comparatively less memory resources for metadata.
Scaling 
Another scenario in which Memcached has an advantage over Redis is in scaling. Because Memcached is multithreaded, you can easily scale up by giving it more computational resources.
Memcached does not support replication.
Memcached is very good to handle high traffic websites. It can read lots of information at a time and give you back at a great response time.

Disadvantage : Memcached's memory management efficiency diminishes quickly when data size is dynamic
Also, large data sets often involve serialized data, which always requires more space to store.Â 
If you are using Memcached then data is lost with a restart and rebuilding cache is a costly process.
Memcached's data eviction mechanism employs a Least Recently Used algorithm and somewhat arbitrarily evicts data that's similar in size to the new data.



Why Redis?
Because of its data structures ( Stores data in a variety of formats: list, array, sets and sorted sets )
Caches employ a mechanism called data eviction to make room for new data by deleting old data from memory.
